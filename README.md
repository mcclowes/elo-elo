# elo-elo

An elo rating implementation.

## Development

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

The test suite exercises the core Elo calculations, verifies that matches are
recorded correctly (including edge-cases such as zero scores), and ensures the
simulation averages multiple runs deterministically.
